# Predictive Analytics: Course Notes, Tests, and Assignments

Welcome! This repository contains the teaching material that I used for a few courses on Predictive Analytics that I taught in 2020-2021 (AFM 346, AFM 416, ACC 690 at the University of Waterloo). The repo includes course notes, assignments, take-home examinations, and other material, including suggested responses for assignments and exams. It does not include discussion questions that we used for live sessions, nor recordings of our lectures.

The course lectures were organized as shown in the outline below. The assignments include solutions in files typically labelled with the suffix *_code*. They also include my guidance notes for TAs reviewing the assignments. I have also included the recommended readings which are available online.

I publish the material as is and, unfortunately, do not have the capacity to provide support to users (answer questions and so on). However, if you find an error or enhancement, feel free to highlight it using Github Issues.
